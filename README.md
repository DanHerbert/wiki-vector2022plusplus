# Wikipedia Vector 2022++ Stylus Theme

This is a [Stylus browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) theme posted to [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world).

Contains minor adjustments to the Vector 2022 skin for Wikipedia that make it
even more readable. The new theme seemed intentionally pretty minimal and meant
to still "feel" like the old Wikipedia. I love the new theme, but wanted a
slightly bolder update that enhances readability even more than the base
changes.

This attempts to keep the spirit of the new default theme, but tries to take
legibility even farther than what Wikimedia already did.
